          <p>Kolkata, Bengali Kalikata, formerly Calcutta, city, capital of West Bengal state, and former capital (1772–1911) of British India. It is one of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports. The city is centred on the east bank of the Hugli (Hooghly) River, once the main channel of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 96 miles (154 km) upstream from the head of the Bay of Bengal; there the port city developed as a point of transshipment from water to land and from river to sea. A city of commerce, transport, and manufacture, Kolkata is the dominant urban centre of eastern India.<br> </br>
        Kolkata is known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India, it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought.Kolkata has been called the "City of Furious, Creative Energy" as well as the "cultural capital of India". The presence of paras, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of the city.Typically, each para has its own community club and on occasion, a playing field.Residents engage in addas, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation. The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda.</p>

            <h3>Kolkata in Winter</h3>
             <br> </br>
             <p>Winter is the peak season for travellers and the most advisable as the weather is just perfect for sightseeing. With the mercury dropping between 15°C and 29°C, the days are neither too hot nor too cold. Sometimes the temperature at night may come down as low as 10°C, so it is better to carry light wools with you. The winter breeze is refreshing and cold, and the days are much calmer. Winter is the peak tourist season though, which means that the city gets more crowded during this time. This may not appeal to you if you?re looking for an idyllic holiday ? opt to stay in a homestay or resort in the outskirts of the city if you?re in the mood for a tranquil vacation.</p>

          <h3>Kolkata in Monsoon</h3>
           <br> </br>
           <p>The southwest monsoon brings heavy showers and thunderstorms to Kolkata, with a high precipitation rate. While this season is more favourable for tourists on a budget than summer, it is still difficult to sightseeing due to the heavy rains and the puddled roads. The evenings and nights are pleasing and refreshing, while the mornings and afternoons are rainy. The temperature ranges between 27°C and 35°C, although the humidity is still high. July and August are the wettest months, while September is decidedly more comfy to travel. You can take a walk by the Hooghly River in the evenings and have pleasant outings as well. Take along umbrellas and rainwear to manoeuvre the monsoon.</p>

          <h3>Kolkata in Summer</h3>
             <br> </br>
             <p>With climate bordering on tropical even though the city of Kolkata is close to the temperate zone, the summers are hot and humid. The proximity to the marshy coast and the Hooghly River ensure that Kolkata has high humidity levels in addition to the soaring heat. With temperatures ranging between 29°C and 45°C, the heat is scorching and very unforgiving. The high humidity makes the weather balmy and uncomfortable. Summer is the least advisable time to visit Kolkata as it is quite challenging to go sightseeing. The crowds make transportation unappealing as well. Summer is the off-season time when prices are at their lowest in Kolkata, which may appeal to travellers on a tight budget. If you want to visit Kolkata in the summer, remember to pack light cotton, linens and other breathable fabric so that you can escape the sweat. Opt to travel in the mornings and evenings so you can avoid the hot afternoons. Carry water and umbrellas to beat the heat.</p>
